# Becoming a Good CRA Citizen: A guide to OpenSSF Projects and the OSPS Baseline

## Description

The projects under development in the OpenSSF provide the pieces to help other open source projects build better security.

Now, with the Open Source Project Security Baseline, we have the missing instruction set to solve the puzzle.

The OSPS Baseline helps projects improve their security posture and transparency while providing the connecting tissue to match controls to external regulatory requirements, like those in the Cyber Resiliency Act. While OSS projects hardly have any obligations within the CRA, this does not stop from playing nice and helping our users!

In this talk, we'll explore how to start implementing the OSPS controls by leveraging the projects in the OpenSSF ecosystem understanding how each implemented control helps downstream consumers (manufacturers) meet a CRA requirement.

Have you ever wondered why those attestations, vulnerability reports, VEX documents, and SBOMs are so important? We'll dive into each as we build a body of evidence to become a good CRA Citizenâ„¢: An OSS project that helps downstream manufacturers meet their regulatory obligations at upstream scale.
