## Teach Your SBOM New Tricks With Bomshell

## Description: 

One of the widest gaps hindering Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) adoption is the diverse structure and content in the documents exchanged today.  

SBOM ingestion is tough: Is your SBOM in SPDX or CycloneDX? Which version? Is it encoded in JSON or tag-value? Do you have a single document or many? Is that SBOM complete, or do you need to enrich it? Is it flat or a full dependency tree?

It seems that every supplier, every tool, and every ecosystem produces a different document which, in turn, isn't compatible with your SBOM systems.
 
Meet bomshell! 

bomshell, a project originally funded by DHS, is a scripting language for SBOM based on CEL. It lets you create programs to work with their contents, regardless of format. bomshell can query SBOMs for data and extract the parts you need. It can combine documents and reshape them into new ones that look exactly the way you need them. Again in any format.

This talk will be rich in demos showing all of bomshell capabilities.

### Goals:

- Help attendees with SBOM consumption by leveraging bomshell scripts
- Rise SBOM awarness, especially about the fact thatthat formats are not important
- Maybe get more contributors for protobom!

### Non-goals:

- SBOM generation
- Introduction to SBOM
